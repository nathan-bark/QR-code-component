## My process

I first started by simply laying out the structure with HTML, using the appropriate semantic tags. I then used CSS grid to place the component in the required location and make the page responsive to device/browser size. Then i finished off with the remaining styling in CSS.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS grid


### What I learned

I got more practice in the different units available for use when sizing grids.

### Continued development

I will try to practice everyday using various sources


### Useful resources
